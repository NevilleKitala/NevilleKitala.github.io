# Setting up your Github account

Think of Github the way you would something more widely used, like Google drive. You can access files you have store in google drive anywhere. You can make changes to the files in google drive from anywhere. You can download them to any computer and edit, or delete them. You can manipulate the files you stored in google drive provided you own the account with those files, or have been given the permission to manipulate them by the owning account.

Github is exactly the same way. The one difference is, Github store the different versions of files that have existed since you first uploaded them. This means that, if the current version of a file is not wanted, I can always find a version that works from its history.

First you will need a Github account.

1. Go to [Github](https://Github.com/).
1. Sign up/ sign in.
1. Thats all for now .. and Welcome to Github!

# Setting up atom:

1. if you haven't already, download atom:
1. When you first open up atom, using the task bar at the top of the application window: Packages > Settings View > Install Packages. Click on **install packages**. The packages you need to install include:

  - Hydrogen
  - Atom Prettify
  - ide-html

1. At the absolute bottom of your screen you will see a Github button. Click on the button and follow the instructions to link atom to your own Github account.

1. You will find atom works very well with Github.

# Your first HTML webpage.

Write or copy the following HTML code into atom:

    ```
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <body>

     <h1>My First Heading</h1>

     <p>My first paragraph.</p>

     </body>
     </html>
```

To open run this file in the browser, you will need to save the file on your computer.You can do this by `Select File > Save as` in the atom menu.

Name the file "index.html". This is convention for naming a first file in most projects in coding. You can name it whatever you like if you prefer.

View your file in your Browser(Mac)/ Explorer(Windows). Notice, it has been automatically identified by your computer as a file that can be opened in your default browser.

 Open the saved HTML file in your favourite browser (double click on the file, or right-click - and choose "Open with").

- The `<!DOCTYPE html> `declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page
- The `<head> `element contains meta information about the HTML page
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
- The `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The `<h1>` element defines a large heading
- The `<p>` element defines a paragraph

# What is an HTML Element?

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
```
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
```

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
