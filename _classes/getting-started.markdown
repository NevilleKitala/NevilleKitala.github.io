# Setting up your Github account

Think of Github the way you would something more widely used, like Google drive. You can access files you have store in google drive anywhere. You can make changes to the files in google drive from anywhere. You can download them to any computer and edit, or delete them. You can manipulate the files you stored in google drive provided you own the account with those files, or have been given the permission to manipulate them by the owning account.

Github is exactly the same way. The one difference is, Github store the different versions of files that have existed since you first uploaded them. This means that, if the current version of a file is not wanted, I can always find a version that works from its history.

First you will need a Github account.

1. Go to [Github](https://Github.com/).
1. Sign up/ sign in.
1. Thats all for now .. and Welcome to Github!

# Setting up atom:

1. if you haven't already, download atom:
1. When you first open up atom, using the task bar at the top of the application window: Packages > Settings View > Install Packages. Click on **install packages**. The packages you need to install include:

  - Hydrogen
  - Atom Prettify
  - ide-html

1. At the absolute bottom of your screen you will see a Github button. Click on the button and follow the instructions to link atom to your own Github account.

1. You will find atom works very well with Github.

# Your first HTML webpage.
 Creating an HTML webpage is trivial.


 An HTML tag is a special word or letter surrounded by angle brackets, < and >. You use tags to create HTML elements , such as paragraphs or links. Many elements have an opening tag and a closing tag â€” for example, a p (paragraph) element has a <p> tag, followed by the paragraph text, followed by a closing </p> tag.
